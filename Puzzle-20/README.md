#### The Challenge:

This is a .NET 8 Blazor Web App with the Interactive render mode set to "WebAssembly" and the Interactivity location set to "Global", However, this problem arises with any flavor of Blazor Web App. Blazor Web Apps do not allow you to use the `<NotFound/>` section in Routes.razor to handle 404 errors. 

How can we implement a 404 page in a Blazor Web App?
