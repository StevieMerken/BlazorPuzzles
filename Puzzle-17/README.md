#### The Challenge:

This is a .NET 8 Blazor Web App with the Interactive render mode set to "Server" and the Interactivity location set to "Global" with sample pages.

While Weather.razor does indeed demonstrate Streaming Rendering, it doesn't quite show off the value of this feature. We want to make it a little more impressive.

We have increased the number of records retrieved to 5000.

Even though the StreamRendering attribute lets us view the page immediately, is there any way we can tighten up the UI so it's more real-world than a table with 5000 records?

NOTE: We do not condone showing 5000 records or more to the user. This is a demo.
