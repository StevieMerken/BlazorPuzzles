<h1>@welcomeMessage</h1>

<p>
    This is a Blazor Web App running on .NET 8 with the Interactive render mode set to "WebAssembly" and the Interactivity location set to "Global".
</p>

<p>
    A WelcomeMessage value is set in appsettings.json on the server.
</p>

<p>
    How can we simply show it here in a Razor page?
</p>


@code {

    string welcomeMessage = string.Empty;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        // This seems to work... until it doesn't.
        welcomeMessage = configuration["WelcomeMessage"];
    }
}
